Hey kahhoe, this journey has been a fruitful one. Thanks for taking up the mantle of leadership after Matthew left and becoming my mentor, reminding me and guiding me in my choices. As you continue on your endeavour (ahem), I pray that you continually draw closer to God in this life. Maybe come back to dance ministry? HAHHA! In any case, thanks for showing me that the depth of the Christian walk is infinitely bigger than me and also to serve as a role model as you pursue your goals ;) I’ll be serving you maybe when you grad and here’s to more lifetime friendship even after we split up :>.
