Hello Brojo!

I think whatever I want to say is already in the little card I gave to you, but here's an extra thank you for all that you have done for the lifegroup. Your journey as our LGL hasn't been easy for sure, especially in the beginning. But, God came through for you and brought you this far, and this journey will now become yet another testimony of His faithfulness in your life! I've really seen how you labored tirelessly for our lifegroup, ensuring that each and every one of us is covered spiritually and growing well. Your heart of being faithful to the things that have been entrusted to you is something that I truly admire. Not many can carry through and be consistent with their efforts, especially when the going gets tough, but you did it! I pray that as you continue your journey of being a LGL in the coming year, your heart for people will grow faster than your people skills will. In times that it gets difficult to love, may you always remember to look to the cross and remember the love you first received. In times that your role is easy to fulfil, may you still always remember to look to the cross and remember that without love, your actions are but an empty gong.

All the best, bro! Here for you even as we step into different ministries, cheering you on and supporting you in whatever way I can!
