Kah Hoe:

I know i have not been in the LG for very long, but thank you so much for being a wonderful group leader, and explaining to me the different terms and activities of the church! Sometimes I ask quite confusing questions and I tend to be skeptical, but I thank you for putting up with it and trying your best to answer nevertheless! I have learn a lot about the basics of Christianity from you that I will definitely cherish. Thank you once again for your contribution to the group and your support during my beginning journey with Christ!
