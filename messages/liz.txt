Yo Kah Hoe! 

Restructuring is coming up and I’m just really thankful to have you as part of my first LG. You’ve guided me in so many ways, provided support for me during times of need, encouraging me and all of us. You’ve shown what it means to follow God and it’s reflected in the way you lead.

Thank you for being a great leader, making the effort to get to know each one of us, catching up with us and being a leader that really gets down and dirty instead of dictating. Getting vulnerable with us and really doing what you say, growing the lg to be a family I’ll never forget. God bless you and I pray that as you keep obeying the lord, he grows you in unimaginable ways as a great teacher! 

All the best in wherever you go, God will always be by your side no matter what!
