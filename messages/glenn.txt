My Brother Jo! Thank God for having you in my life, and I really learnt so so much from you. Thank you for being the LGL! Don't let this get to your head but you seriously teach very well by being the relatable, entertaining and wise person you are. Thank you for being my mentor and a brother who always believes in me and imparting so much of your wisdom and skills to me! Despite all the things you have struggled with through the past year, knowing how you still choose to honour God with your very best really inspires me. I pray that for the rest of the year and so forth, you will really continue to grow and gain new and godly perspectives, to become a good servant of Christ and a massive blessing to those around you. Lastly, thank you for doing life together and just want to let you know that I have your back, brother! :)
