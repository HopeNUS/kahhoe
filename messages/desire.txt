Hey KH! As i’m writing this, idk if it’s gonna be a goodbye see you around, or omg cant wait for next year restructuring. HAHA LOL JK! i can never say these things because you’re a brother to keep for life yo! really so blessed to be in the lg ever since i joined NUS, to grow in character and also in my walk with God. thank you for seeing the best in me, to give me opportunities to serve out of my comfort zone and to try new things. it has made me see how you never underestimate anyone, and how you see us through God’s lens. even though you’re busy meeting people back to back, juggling with many events and such, you still never fail to invest in each of our lives. thank you for showing me how to love and to go the extra mile for God and His people, like how you mentioned in your teaching, to be involved not informed. You’re not just a great leader, but you’re first a great brother. and dudeeeee i really admire your humbleness and vulnerability to share about your personal life and struggles. and to not like hold on to the whole “oh i’m a LEADER, must be perfect in front of everyone”. ok lah you confirm got aaaaa lot more you never share, but i can see how you take every turning and learning point that you’ve been through and use them to testify about God’s goodness and faithfulness, believing it would encourage and help us walk closer to God. wah there’s so much to say but idk how big the card is so imma stop here. aiyah you don’t need people’s affirmation, all that matters is that God knows haha. you’re gifted and blessed by God, so do use them well for God! (i know you will!) ok if i’m staying in your lg, cant wait to support you and to journey with you and the lg! but if i’m moving out of the lg, please read the next sentence. i’ll miss you brother! :)
