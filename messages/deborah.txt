Hey Kah hoe (Bro Jo)! 

You’re a one hilarious guy, often joking and fooling around with your weird actions. HAHAHAHA. You’re real funny and comfortable to joke around with. You’re also a caring person, know that you always invest in people, often having meet ups and checking up on people in their walk with God. You are a person filled with wisdom and knowledgable too! I know that I can come to you with questions and for advices. Sometimes you might not have answers but you’ll try your best to advice. Really learnt alot from you! Kinda sad that I’m moving on to adult’s ministry already, will definitely miss your teachings and your weird antics. Guess I can only see them through insta stories. HAHA. Anyway, God bless and may you continue to be a leader that others will look up to and one that will share God’s heart. Thanks for leading the life group, continue to be on fire for God and to disciple and point others towards God! 

God bless,
Deborah (Sister Png)
