Hey Kah Hoe! Just want to say I'm thankful and very blessed to have you as my LGL for the past 1 year. Thank you for everything you've invested in this LG such as blessing us with little gifts, always keeping the LG spirit up w yr humor hahaha, imparting wisdom to point us back to God and keeping a look out for every one of us. Pray that as you enter yr next LG, may you be able to journey another exciting journey with His people and also I hope you'll continue to have a good core team and members that will support you well! See ya around ~
