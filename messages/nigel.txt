Hey Kah Hoe! 
It’s been about 2yrs plus already since first being in the same Lg together to you leading a life group and eventually becoming my mentor. It’s been a real pleasure to be able to grow alongside you and to watch you  step out of your comfort zone to take on tasks irregardless of how full your plate might be. From your vulnerable and personal sharings to your weird, quirky sides, God has indeed grown you and shaped you to be able to connect to people easily hahaha 
I think one of your best traits is how intentional you are in reaching out and enfolding others, I remember like seeing your timetable during the time you were interning, it was filled with meetups with people be it the newer ones or even older ones and like how you got me a cake and cake to my house to pass it to me even when I wasn’t home hahaha 
I remember the ‘good times’ we had going overseas, be it JB or Krabi hahaha
Thanks for being there to spur me on and to support me in times when I was having certain doubts about the church and stuff, never failing to lead me back to the one thing that matters which is God and His word. 
Constantly setting an example for me, in spite of ‘rank, position or any other title in the future’ to always be reminded of His grace and to always have the heart of repentance. 
This seems like some farewell message but hopefully it’s not the last time we talk to or see each other even as I move on to a different ministry. 
May God continue to reveal Himself to you and use you for His kingdoms’ purpose
