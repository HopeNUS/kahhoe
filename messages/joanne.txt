BRO HOEEEEEE!!!

Wahhhhh it's restructuring already though it felt like just recently that I joined this ministry. You were my first point of contact with hopeuni and a really positive one! I still remember bits and pieces of the convo we had at northpoint and in hindsight I must have felt really comfortable with you to be able to share about so much stuff on our first meeting. You're someone so knowledgeable, so patient and funny and one who is so faithful to our Father! 

I really hope we'll be in the same LG again bc I'll miss your nonsense (and amazing teachings!!) but even if otherwise, please know that I really treasure the past year of memories and I'm glad I got the opportunity to be led by you :) Wah I can't help but think back when you found out I was sick and came all the way to my house with sushi BUT I wasn't home TT__TT. Back then I was still quite new to the LG but you still went the extra mile to show your care, I was very very very gan dong!!

I constantly thank God for placing you in my life during such a major transitional period. You're so obedient and sensitive to the Holy Spirit, surely He'll use you for great things to come and I can't wait to bear witness to them!

No matter what let's continue to keep in contact ya!! North buddies heheheh!!!!
