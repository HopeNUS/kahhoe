Yooooo jobro, hahaha wah it’s been more than one year already that i’ve known you, and been really blessed to have you as a friend and an lgl. Thanks for being such an intentional friend and leader, who always tries his best to connect to all of us, gives advice to the best of your knowledge and ability and has such a humble heart to listen and obey. You’ve led our lg well with grace and strength, never hesitating to ask for opinions and input from everyone while looking out for us. Thanks for your care and concern when we have our one-to-one talks, guidance when it comes to my walk with God, growing as a member of the church and relationship issues, an your encouragement over the past year. I hope that in the coming year, we’ll both continue to grow in our walks, overcome any challenges we face along the way, with the help of the community!
