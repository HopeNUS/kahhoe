Hey Kahhou, thank you for your faithfulness and consistency in leading and feeding His flock in this season, amidst all that you are juggling. Indeed, do not become weary in doing good, feeling like there’s no point to it all, for at a proper time you would reap a harvest if you do not give up. You’re so blessed, to have a bunch of people that support and honor you. Yet, the call to building His church is ultimately the call the servanthood, one that can get difficult and ugly at times. Am praying this day that God would strengthen you with might in your inner man, that you may comprehend the extents of his love for you, in order that you would be firmly convicted of His love for you even when things don’t go well. Love you bro.
