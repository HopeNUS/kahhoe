Dear Kah Hoe,
Although you are the only LGL Iâ€™ve had since I joined this Church, I can feel that you will be the best LGL I will ever have. Not only are you highly praised within the LG, but also well spoken of among other LGs. Hearing others speak highly of you makes me proud to have you as my leader. Keep up the good work and may God continue to pour his many wisdoms and blessings upon you. :))
